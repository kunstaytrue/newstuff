Project Overview

MacDylan Holdings is a dynamic logistics and transport solutions company dedicated to providing reliable, efficient, and customer-focused services across South Africa and the wider region. Founded with a vision to bridge gaps in transportation and distribution, the company has steadily grown from a small local operator into a trusted name in the industry.

The project aims to establish a strong digital and corporate presence for MacDylan Holdings through the development of a professional website, company profile, and branding material. The website will serve as the primary communication platform for clients, partners, and stakeholders, showcasing the company’s history, services, mission, vision, and values (Chaffey, 2015).

This initiative is designed to:

Highlight the company’s identity by presenting a clear “Who We Are” section, backed by an authentic history and strong narrative.

Communicate core values and principles, including reliability, professionalism, and customer satisfaction.

Showcase services in transport, logistics, and related solutions, positioning MacDylan Holdings as a trusted partner in the industry.

Build credibility with well-structured content, professional imagery, and academic-style referencing where applicable (Kotler & Keller, 2016).

Enhance visibility and growth opportunities by creating a strong online footprint that supports client acquisition, tenders, and partnerships (Laudon & Traver, 2021).

Ultimately, this project provides MacDylan Holdings with the tools and presence required to compete in today’s digital-first business landscape, aligning the company’s operations with its long-term mission of delivering excellence in logistics.

Part 3: Notable Changes 
1. Visual and User Interface Enhancements
1.1 Services Page

Several interface improvements were implemented on the Services page.
Firstly, interactive accordions were added using JavaScript and CSS to present information in a more organised and space-efficient manner. When a user clicks on a service category, the section expands to reveal detailed information.
Secondly, a search functionality was introduced to allow users to quickly filter services according to keywords, thereby improving navigation and accessibility.

1.2 Request a Quote Page

A “Go to Gallery” button was added to provide direct access to the Gallery page.
The Gallery itself was upgraded using a Lightbox system, enabling images to zoom slightly on hover and expand into a full-screen viewer when selected. Users can navigate through the gallery using image controls, creating a more interactive viewing experience.

1.3 Contact Page

The interactive map embedded within the Contact page was reduced in height to improve visual balance.
Additionally, the website colour palette was adjusted to incorporate more green tones, which enhances visual consistency and aligns better with the brand identity.

1.4 About Us Page

Accordions and modal components were added to the About Us page to increase interactivity. Smooth animations were also integrated to create a more dynamic user experience.

2. Functional and Technical Enhancements
2.1 JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

A number of JavaScript improvements were made across the website.
Form validation was implemented to ensure that users provide correct and complete information before submitting forms.
All forms were successfully connected to EmailJS, allowing them to send user input directly to an external email service.
Additional JavaScript features implemented across various pages include:

Accordions

Modals

Real-time search filtering

Lightbox gallery functionality

Improved event handling and interactive elements

DOM manipulation techniques were used throughout the site to create dynamic content and improve user engagement.

3. SEO Enhancements
3.1 On-Page SEO

Each page was updated with suitable meta descriptions, titles, and keywords to improve visibility on search engines. This includes page-specific metadata such as descriptions related to MacDylan Holdings.
Internal structure was improved through consistent use of semantic HTML and accessibility attributes.

3.2 Off-Page SEO

To demonstrate off-page optimisation, backlinks and placeholder social media links were included.
Even though the company currently does not operate social media accounts, these additions were made to illustrate capability and knowledge of off-page SEO techniques.

3.3 Technical SEO

Two important technical SEO files were added:

robots.txt, used to guide search engine crawlers on which pages to index or avoid.

sitemap.xml, which provides a complete map of the site’s structure for better indexing and search engine comprehension.

These additions improve the website’s overall discoverability and search engine performance.

4. Summary

The work completed resulted in substantial improvements to the website’s interface, functionality, and search engine optimisation.
Through the addition of interactive components, enhanced JavaScript logic, comprehensive SEO structures, and crawler guidance files, the website now demonstrates improved usability, technical depth, and professional quality.
